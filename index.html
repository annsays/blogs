            <br>
            <p class="text-center" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">JULY  1st, 2020</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">I was just like you sometime ago searching for 'purpose in life' on the internet.Only later did I realise that we cannot find it at all, no matter how many websites we keep visiting.Truth to be told <strong>we'll never know our purpose our entire life!</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">Let me tell you why,with the help of a short story:</p>
            <p class="lead">A king once lived in a far off kingdom.He was admired by his countrymen because he was kind,honest & a wise man.He kept before him the interests of his people over his own.Life threw in a lot of obstacles on his way but he faced and conquered them all.The king just like many of us wanted to find his purpose in life.His entire life he kept searching for it.The result of which undoubtedly made him the most beloved king of his times.One day very unexpectedly the king died.Everyone mourned his death.Years passed by, yet the stories of 'their most beloved king' was being passed on for generations to hear .People drew comparisions between the succeeding kings as to who was closest in governance compared to that of 'their beloved king'.Because of which,everyone who inherited the throne was in a constant state of competition with themselves to prove their selves worthy just like their 'predecessor'.Hence <strong>the governance in that entire kingdom was always admirable.</strong></p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>'The governance in that entire kingdom was always admirable'</strong>, this was the purpose of that king who graced the earth years back.To set an example,to motivate & to push his heirs to do their best. The irony of this situation is 'the purpose' he was searching for his entire life was found out only after his death by the people who's lives he had touched or made an impact on while he lived.The same applies to us as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">You will never find your purpose while you live but people who knew you will find it out for you after you die.This is called leaving behind legacy.Now your wrong if you think only the elite  can leave behind a legacy.Legacy is for all , but how you shape it is upto you.In fact that is the only thing under your control.</p>
            <p class="lead">I would never urge people to impact thousands of lives because i believe one life is equally good.If you can bring about a positive permanent change in one persons life,you are as good as the one who changed thousands.</p>
            <p class="lead">So its as simple as that dont keep searching for purpose,all you have to do is start shaping your legacy.And you'll have to start now because we all are living under a constant fear as to when we'll die.And also when we shape our legacy we should make sure its a good one,because obviously deep down you want people to say 'I want to be like him/her' after you die.</p>
